# # How will you keep track of whose turn it is?
# Boolean variable that updates to reflect whose turn it is

# # What data structure will you use to keep track of the board? You only
# #   know two (Array, Hash), but remember they can be nested (meaning an
# #   array can contain another arrayâ€”it can even contain a hash that contains
# #   another hash, though unclear if that will be useful :P)
# Array of strings

# # When a player makes a move, what should happen?
# The value at that index should update to be either x or o, depending on the player.

# # How do you keep track of which squares have Xs and which have Os?
# "The values at that square's index."

# # How do you detect a winner?
# A "game over" method/variable.

# # When does the program stop? Is there a loop? If so, what kind?
# The program stops either when the game is over or it is a cats game.
