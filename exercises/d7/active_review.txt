find vs find_by -- you give find an id, say find(1), and it returns the row with that id. you use find_by if you want to look up something by, say, username or tweet body. You would say find_by(:name => "Lowen")

where vs find_by -- I am still not completely sure, but it seems like you can pass .where more specific parameters
