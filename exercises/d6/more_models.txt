Models:
Users - Attributes: ID, username, password, Name, Addresses (billing and shipping), payment information
Items - Attributes: ID, price, quantity, description, rating, seller, name
Cart - Attributes: ID, items, user

I combined account and user because I am going to assume that each user has one account and their attributes were pretty similar (name, address, username, password)

Items belong to carts
Carts belong to users
Carts have many items

Users to carts - 1 to 1
Carts to items - Many to many
